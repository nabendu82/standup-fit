# standup-fit
Firefox addon to remind to standup every hour

This addon is mainly for developers, who sits all day and code. We often forget to even standup and walk for a minute. Scientific studies shows that the people who work all days in a chair are at risk of getting many chronic disease including spondylitis.
So, get up from your chair every one hour(reminded by our lovely notifications) and be healthy, so that you can code more.
